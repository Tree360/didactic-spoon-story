There once was a tree named Oak in a vast woodlands comprised of four nations: Trees, Praries, Farms, and Rivers. The woodlands were at peace with eachother for thousands of years until one day the farm 
nation suddenly attacked. Now Oak, the last TreeBender, must master all forms of woodlands and defeat the farm nation using only his trusty spoon as a weapon.

TreeBender basically bends tree.

and the crowd goes WILD.
